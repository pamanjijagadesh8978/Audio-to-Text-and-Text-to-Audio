üìä Reddit Relevance Analyzer
This Streamlit application combines social media data scraping (Reddit via PRAW), Natural Language Processing (NLTK) for keyword extraction, and advanced Language Models (Azure Mistral via LangChain) to quickly search, retrieve, and score Reddit posts based on their relevance to a specific research question.

The core goal is to filter noise and identify highly relevant, actionable, or method-specific posts on a large scale.

‚ú® Features
Targeted Reddit Search: Searches specific subreddits using keywords extracted from a user-defined research question.

Intelligent Keyword Extraction: Uses NLTK's Part-of-Speech tagging to identify strong keywords (Nouns, Adjective-Noun pairs) from the query for more precise searching.

LLM-Powered Relevance Scoring: Submits batches of posts (title and body/link) to a Mistral AI model (hosted on Azure) for relevance scoring (1-5 scale) against the research question.

Asynchronous Processing: Uses asyncio and semaphores to concurrently manage API calls to the LLM, dramatically speeding up the analysis of multiple posts.

Robust Retries: Implements exponential backoff and retry logic using tenacity to handle transient API issues and improve stability.

Real-time Results: Displays posts ranked by their calculated relevance score in the Streamlit UI.
